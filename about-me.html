                <br><h1>About Matt</h1>
                <p>I grew up on a small farm outside of Rickardsville, IA.  I went to Wartburg College to wrestle and ended up getting my Bachelors Degree in Secondary English Education.  I taught high school English for 2 years in New London, IA.  Since I was the new teacher, I seemed to get all of the extra responsibilities: newspaper, yearbook, assistant wrestling coach, fall play director.  This was right in the middle of the late nineties tech boom, so although my life was very busy, living in rural Iowa felt stagnant compared to what was happening throughout the rest of the country.</p>
                <p>An opportunity presented itself to get into web development, and I jumped at the chance to move to Orlando, FL. During my time there, I was part of a group that founded an online pet supply company.  The company grew at an extreme pace, and before I knew it I was moving to Kansas City to manage this new venture.</p>
                <p>In 2008, I decided to venture out on my own, and started my own company.  I have been selling animal health supplies ever since.  For the past 5 years most of my sales have been through the Fulfillment by Amazon program.  I have had some very successful years, where sales have been over $2 million. Selling on Amazon via FBA is a strange business, as many times you feel as if you have no control over your inventory.  I was looking to make a switch, and once I found out about devCodeCamp I felt like a career as a programmer would be rewarding.</p>
                <p>During my time at devCodeCamp I have learned C#, and well as HTML and CSS.  I have also learned a different way to analzye a problem and break it down into it's simplest form.  Then all you have to do is solve it one step at a time.</p>
